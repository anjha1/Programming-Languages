""" Write a function check_duplicate(Lst) which returns True if a list Lst contains duplicate elements. 
It should return False if all the elements in the list Lst are unique. 
Lst = [4,6,2,1,6,7,4]   
# Should return true as 4 and 6 appears more than once.
 Lst = [1,2,3,12,4]
 # Should return false as all the elements appears only once"""
