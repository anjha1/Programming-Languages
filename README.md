   - **Objective:** Develop a solid understanding of essential data structures and algorithms.
   - **Content:** Includes code examples and exercises for data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, recursion).
   - **Technologies Used:** Generic implementations in multiple languages like C++, Java, and Python for cross-language understanding.
   - **Applications:** Prepares for coding interviews and competitive programming.

### 2. **Java with DSA & System Design**
   - **Objective:** Explore Java with a focus on data structures and system design patterns.
   - **Content:** Covers foundational topics in Java programming, followed by DSA concepts and system design principles.
   - **Features:**
     - Array manipulation, linked lists, trees, and graphs
     - Introduction to Java design patterns and system architecture concepts
   - **Ideal For:** Beginners learning Java and intermediate developers focusing on system design for scalability and efficiency.

### 3. **Java**
   - **Objective:** Understand core Java concepts, syntax, and object-oriented programming.
   - **Content:** Includes Java basics, object-oriented programming principles, exception handling, and file management.
   - **Learning Path:** Progresses from foundational topics to more advanced Java concepts to build a well-rounded skill set in Java.

### 4. **Python**
   - **Objective:** Gain practical knowledge in Python, with applications in both general programming and data analysis.
   - **Content:** Features exercises in Python basics, data manipulation, and real-world problem-solving.
   - **Projects and Exercises:** Includes coding tasks that reinforce Python syntax, data types, control structures, and common libraries.
   - **Ideal For:** All levels, with exercises catering to beginners through intermediate Python developers.

### 5. **C++**
   - **Objective:** Develop proficiency in C++ and understand memory management, pointers, and object-oriented programming.
   - **Content:** Covers foundational topics, advanced data structures, and algorithm implementation.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Memory management and pointers
     - Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
   - **Applications:** C++ is valuable for systems programming, game development, and situations requiring high performance.
